    <h2>A delicious meal for a beautiful summer day!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack spare ribs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry rub of your choice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons beef seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat your smoker.</strong> to 250 degrees F. Use your favorite hardwood. I recommend fruit, hickory, or apple woods.</li>
            <li><strong>Trim your ribs.</strong> Remove the large segment of bones on top of the ribs, the thin flap and membrane on the back of the ribs, and the tail end of the ribs.</li>
            <li><strong>Season your ribs.</strong> Sprinkle on your sweet seasoning, your beef seasoning, and then the black pepper. Cover the top, bottom, and all sides of the ribs.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoke your ribs.</strong> No spritzing, no wrapping, no saucing, NO PEEKING! Get those ribs on your smoker and let them roll for at least 4 hours before you open the lid and start checking on your ribs. 
                Once your ribs reach an internal temperature of 200-205 degrees F and are tender when you bend them, remove your ribs to a cutting board.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest your ribs.</strong> Let your ribs rest on your cutting board for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
